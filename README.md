# Openapi Search

_Fast_ and _easy_ search if for a given URL or keyword a OpenAPI specification from the BundDEV project exists.


Just paste the URL of the API you discovered, and the tool will search for a matching OpenAPI specification.

The fuzzy search will only check server URLs from the OpenAPI specification at the moment.



Go to [https://t-huyeng.github.io/openapi-search/](https://t-huyeng.github.io/openapi-search/) to try it out.

## List of OpenAPI specifications
See: [https://t-huyeng.github.io/bunddev-apis/](https://t-huyeng.github.io/bunddev-apis/) for a list of all OpenAPI specifications from the BundDev project (including serverURLs).
